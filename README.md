# Use interface and abstract.
This quick repo is about learning how to apply interfaces and abstract classes, as I am learning Java in class.

## Origin
This repo came from the school work of calculating the volume of a cone, but what the heck why not include more?!

## Different Shapes
I am also calculating other shapes and using the knowledge of overloading.
